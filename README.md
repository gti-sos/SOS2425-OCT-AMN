 ### Project Description
My project focuses on the innovative analysis of forest fire data, integrating it with information from other sources, 
which I access through the APIs of my classmates from the SOS course. My main goal is to identify patterns and connections to better understand 
the causes and impact of fires in Spain, and thus improve prevention and response to these emergencies that affect our ecosystems every year. 
This will contribute to the development of more efficient and sustainable fire management strategies.
